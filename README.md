# Text Summarization

## Overview

The **Text Summarization** project is designed to automatically generate concise summaries from larger bodies of text. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project focuses on extractive summarization, which identifies and extracts the most relevant sentences from the original text to create a coherent summary. This approach is particularly useful for quickly understanding the main points of lengthy documents, articles, or reports.

## Purpose

In today's information-rich environment, the ability to quickly digest large volumes of text is essential. This project aims to:

- **Enhance Productivity**: Allow users to save time by providing quick summaries of lengthy documents.
- **Facilitate Information Retrieval**: Help users identify key information without reading entire texts.
- **Support Research and Analysis**: Assist researchers and analysts in summarizing relevant literature and data.

## Features

- **Extractive Summarization**: Automatically extracts key sentences from the input text based on word frequency and relevance.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes the spaCy library for tokenization, stop word removal, and sentence segmentation.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Users can adjust the length of the summary based on their needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **spaCy**
- **Heapq**: A Python library for efficiently retrieving the largest elements from a collection.
